Light intensity stuff:

E = Illuminance in lux (lux or lm/m^2)
I = Luminous intensity in candela (cd)
Φ = Luminous flux (lumen, lm)
r = Distance in metres

Lumens measure a light source's total light output, while candelas measure the intensity in a specific direction, and lux measures how much light falls on a surface.

For example, if you have a flashlight that is 2 lumens, and you tighten the beam, it will have higher intensity, so more cancelas. Intensity and distance affect how much the light illuminates the surface in lux.


Illuminance based on intensity and distance (inverse-square law):
E = I​ / r^2

Tilt / cosine term, when surface is not perpendicular:
E = I​ * cos(theta) / r^2
where theta is the angle between surface normal and light direction (towards the light source).

Candela <-> lumen (direction vs total flux):
Φ = I * Ω
I = Φ / Ω
where Ω is the solid angle in steradians.
If a light source is isotropic, meaning it is uniform in all directions, then Ω = 4pi.
